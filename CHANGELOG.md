# Changelog

The release notes for every published version are in [docs/release-notes](docs/release-notes/index.md).

This file lists the changes merged since the last release. Add an entry under [Unreleased] in the same pull request as the change, under the heading of the section it belongs to: `### New features`, `### Improvements`, `### Bug fixes`, `### Security fixes`, `### Deprecations and removals`, `### Known issues` or `### Packaging notes`. Write it for people who use myflames, the way the release notes are written (docs/DEVELOPER_REFERENCE.md, "Release notes"). When a version ships, its entries move into `docs/release-notes/X.Y.Z.md` and this section starts empty again.

## [Unreleased]

### New features

- Added mouse-wheel and trackpad zoom to the Database diagram, with a Diagram wheel zoom speed setting in Settings > Workspace for both the diagram and Mermaid preview.

### Improvements

- Changed Mermaid preview wheel zoom to follow scroll distance, giving small trackpad movements a smoother response.
